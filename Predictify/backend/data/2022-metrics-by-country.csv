,"1 Due to rounding, some total numbers may not equal the sum of the subcomponents.",,,,,,,
,"2 Data is based on assets where we have operational control. Environmental data is represented as 100% ownership interest regardless of actual share owned by ConocoPhillips with acquisitions and divestitures aligned with financial reporting. To provide the most current and accurate data available, we have updated previously reported data for prior years as needed.",,,,,,,
,"3 Updated in 2022, GHG metrics are reported to the nearest whole number in each unit, except intensity or other metrics expressed as ratios.",,,,,,,
,4 All Others includes Indonesia and Malaysia.,,,,,,,
,5 Includes water withdrawn from saline/brackish groundwater aquifers and seawater.,,,,,,,
,"6 Includes produced water recycled for production (e.g., steam generation) or completions (e.g., hydraulic fracturing) and produced water reused for enhanced oil recovery.",,,,,,,
,7 Regulatory definitions for hazardous and non-hazardous waste vary between countries and jurisdictions. Data is based on country and jurisdictional definitions.,,,,,,,
,"8 Workforce for All Others includes China, Malaysia and other small operations. ",,,,,,,
,"9 Data is normalized using barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) from production operations, including gas plant liquid production of ethane, propane, butane and condensate and production from third-party gas not accounted for in production operations. For gas production, 6,000 standard cubic feet of gas is assumed to equal one BOE.",,,,,,,
