# climate-predictive-modeling
Repository for the Conoco Phillips Track for CodeRED (Genisis), the largest hackathon in Houston. 
Our project is known as Predictify, a tool to help with company-wide efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.

The program uses a polynomial regression model using Python's Scikit library to predict future CO2 emissions from different gloabl Conoco Phillips locations. Prediction data is displayed on a map and on an interactive chart displayed with re-chart. 

Our application also features an AI assistant that can answer any questions related to obtaining goals related to sustainability. ![Uploading Scr![Screenshot 2024-02-13 145303](https://github.com/jaykeburger/climate-predictive-modeling/assets/76579098/e47ce47d-15e2-4f06-8ac1-b685aa10cbde)
